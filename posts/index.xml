      <description>Let go through and try to understand how easy it can be to send and receive messages on tcp socket.
Lets first talk about the server and how to build one.
package main import ( &amp;#34;fmt&amp;#34; &amp;#34;net&amp;#34; ) func main() { listener, err := net.Listen(&amp;#34;tcp&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;:8080&amp;#34;) if err != nil { panic(err) } defer listener.Close() for { conn, err := listener.Accept() fmt.Println(&amp;#34;request received&amp;#34;) if err != nil { panic(err) } go handleConnection(conn) } } func handleConnection(conn net.</description>

If a program is unable to do so, it causes memory leaks b. When trying to allocate some memory for the program is the program able to get memory that is not being used by any other programs</description>
